# Essentially I will need you to write the assess_food function which will
# take all the food in the today_food.csv and assess whether the user has met
# the values in the FDA_DV file.
# If they have, simply tell them good job or whatever but if they
# are low in something tell them how much more they need and then make
# suggestions on what they should eat.
# You should first make suggestions from the frequent foods
# file which will tell you what each food has a high content of.
# If no high value foods exist in the frequent foods file just use the default
# foods file which has some common foods that are high in the four nutrients

# I would suggest giving this a couple runs using the barcodes I provided.
# You can even use some foods you have too.
# Just take a look at how the data gets put in the files.
# If you want to see how the data is put into the frequent foods file, just
# add the Meijer Hot Chocolate I provided 4 times because that is high enough
# in calcium to be considered high

# A couple of bar codes I used to test this all
